- 👋 Hi, I’m @NerbalOne
- 👀 I’m interested in Information Security and Blue Team related items. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SIEM Architecture, Sysmon, and SentinelOne.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on SentinelOne STAR rules.

PS - I don't create repos for the credit and I don't want to steal credit. If credit is due, someone please tell me. I create repos so others can learn and use it.
